            <img class="images" src="images/priv-sec.jpg">
            <p>Working with private sector organizations to support and promote their
                endeavor in the public sector arena, IPoint Advisors provides the
                following services that are tailored to meet our clients' specific
                objectives:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>Advocacy: </h3>
                    <p>We assist clients with developing a legislative and/or political
                        strategy that will achieve their specific objectives while complying with
                        the political landscape and sound public policy. IPoint Advisors also
                        guides our private sector clients in their analysis of current public
                        policy relative to their objective, so they can better define their
                        position. With strategies and policy positions in place, we represent our
                        clients' interests before local, county and state agencies.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Government Procurement:</h3>
                    <p>By guiding our clients through the procurement
                        process, IPoint Advisors assists our clients in securing governmental
                        contracts. Due to our positioning with numerous public agencies, we are
                        often able to identify contract opportunities and present them to our
                        clients. Our staff is well versed in minority and women business
                        enterprise teaming arrangements and can provide introductions for our
                        clients to key business owners.</p>

                <li>
                    <h3>Community Outreach:</h3>
                    <p> Duly integrated in local, regional and state business and political communities, we are well
                        positioned to identify potential contractors and subcontractors for our clients' consideration
                        that meet MBE/WBE qualifications and enjoy outstanding business reputations.

                        and other key stakeholders, strategies may either be grassroots-oriented or based in community
                        relations or ally development.
