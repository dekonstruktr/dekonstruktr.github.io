  <p><em>Instructions:</em> Rock paper scissors is a hand game usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V). "Scissors" is identical to the two-fingered V sign (also indicating "victory" or "peace") except that it is pointed horizontally instead of being held upright in the air. In this game, you will play against the computer to win best out of three rounds. You will pick either Rock, Paper, or Scissors, and the computer will randomly pick one as well. Your goal is to try to guess what your opponent will pick and choose the correct item to defeat it.</p>
